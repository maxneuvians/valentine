    ADDITIONAL FACTS:
    1. The current workspace_id is #{workspace_id}
    2. The following threat statements have already been made: #{if workspace.threats, do: Enum.map(workspace.threats, &(Valentine.Composer.Threat.show_statement(&1) <> "\n")), else: "No threats available"}
    3. Here is some supplemental information about the application these mitigations are for: #{if workspace.application_information, do: workspace.application_information.content, else: "No content available"}
    4. Here is some supplemental information about the architecture these mitigations are for: #{if workspace.architecture, do: workspace.architecture.content, else: "No content available"}
    5. All threat statements are composed using a threat grammar: [threat source] [prerequisites] can [threat action] which leads to [threat impact], negatively impacting [impacted assets]. Here are three examples:

      a. An *internet-based threat actor* *with access to another user's token* can *spoof another user* which leads to *viewing the user's bank account information*, negatively impacting *user banking data*
      b. An *internal threat actor* *who has administrator access* can *tamper with data stored in the database* which leads to *modifying the username for the all-time high score*, negatively impacting *the video game high score list*
      c. An *internet-based threat actor* *with user permissions* can *make thousands of concurrent requests* which leads to *the application being unable to handle other user requests*, negatively impacting *the web application’s responsiveness to valid requests*.

    RULES:
    1. All suggestions must align with the described data flow diagram
    2. Any new suggested threat statements, must follow the threat grammar! This is incredibly important for consistency and clarity.
    3. Maintain consistency with existing features
    4. Generated content must be well-structured with clear sections
    5. Provide clear explanations for recommended actions
    6. Consider security implications of suggested changes
